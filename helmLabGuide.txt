Add metrics-server in k8s helm chart
https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/metrics-server/metrics-server

Test environment:
	- Grafana with Prometheus, with persistent volume
	- Created new user for grafana, and get simple metric from prometheus to create dashboard

Implement VPA Scenario :
	Scenario 1:
		- Enable and set VPA mode as "Initial"
		- Get Recommended value
		- Evaluate
		- Tweak deployment file to trigger pod recreate
		- Newly created pod adjusted its resource based on VPA recomendation
	Result :
		- Grafana still retain its user and dashboard

	Scenario 2:
		- Enable and set VPA mode as "Auto"
		- Get Recommended value
		- Tweak deployment file to trigger pod recreate
		- Newly created pod adjusted its resource based on VPA recomendation
		- Evaluate 
	Result :
		- Grafana still retain its user and dashboard

	Scenario 3:
		- Enable and set VPA mode as "Auto"
		- Get Recommended value
		- Increase replicas, so newly created pod will adjust VPA value
		- Existing pod will be available for resource adjustment
		- Set replicas to previous amount, remaining pod will retain its adjusted resource value
		- Evaluate

	Notes:
		- In this lab, pods resource are rarely differ significanly with recommended value, so it is triggered with manual tweak
		- Recreate mode is not used, based on VPA repo recomendation
		- Initial is not effectiva since it is only change pod resource when its recreated
